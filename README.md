# Last-Checkpoint

Hey there,

My coding journey started because I was tired of just using apps and websites and wanted to know how to build them. Now, after this bootcamp, I'm equal parts terrified and excited.

My biggest fight was with async/await – I think I dreamt about it for a week! But the moment I finally got my real-time chat feature to work without breaking, I felt like a wizard.

I'm most proud of [DirassaGram], because it actually solves a problem my friends (Rayan and Sarah and I have.

I know 5 months isn't enough to be professional fullstack developer, and I still have a lot to learn and practice—especially as I'm also an L1 International Business student! But you gave me a solid foundation and the confidence to keep building on my own.

Thank you for the great experience. I'm now ready to start applying these skills and continue learning.
